# Frontend runtime configuration for development
# When running `yarn dev`, Vite will use this to set env variables.
# API base path for the frontend to call. In production, we default to window.origin + '/api'.
# Example to point to a different backend during development:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
# Alternatively, use the dev proxy by setting:
# VITE_DEV_API_TARGET=http://localhost:8000
